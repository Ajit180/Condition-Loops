Q1. What are conditional statements? Explain conditional statements with syntax and examples.

Solution:

 Conditional statements in programming are used to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. They allow the program to make decisions and choose different courses of action depending on the values of variables or the result of logical expressions. In JavaScript, conditional statements are implemented using `if`, `else if`, and `else` constructs.

### Syntax of Conditional Statements
#### 1. `if` Statement:
```javascript
if (condition) {
  // Code to be executed if the condition is true
}
```

#### 2. `if...else` Statement:
```javascript
if (condition) {
  // Code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  // Code to be executed if the condition is false
}
```

#### 3. `if...else if...else` Statement:
```javascript
if (condition1) {
  // Code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // Code to be executed if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
  // Code to be executed if both condition1 and condition2 are false
}
```

### Examples of Conditional Statements
#### 1. Using `if` Statement:
```javascript
let hour = 15;

if (hour < 12) {
  console.log("Good morning!");
}
```

#### 2. Using `if...else` Statement:
```javascript
let age = 20;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are eligible to vote.");
} else {
  console.log("You are not eligible to vote.");
}
```

#### 3. Using `if...else if...else` Statement:
```javascript
let score = 75;

if (score >= 90) {
  console.log("Grade: A");
} else if (score >= 80) {
  console.log("Grade: B");
} else if (score >= 70) {
  console.log("Grade: C");
} else {
  console.log("Grade: D");
}
```

### Explanation
- In the `if` statement, the code block is executed if the condition inside the parentheses evaluates to `true`.
- In the `if...else` statement, if the condition is `true`, the code block inside the `if` block is executed; otherwise, the code block inside the `else` block is executed.
- In the `if...else if...else` statement, multiple conditions can be checked sequentially. If the condition associated with `if` or `else if` evaluates to `true`, the corresponding code block is executed. If none of the conditions are met, the code block inside the `else` block is executed.
